##Overview
This server-based application, built with Node.js and Express, manages and automates email responses for Google and Outlook accounts. By leveraging BullMQ as a task scheduler, the server parses incoming emails, uses AI to analyze the context, and responds accordingly. This project integrates multiple services and APIs to provide a seamless and intelligent email management experience.
